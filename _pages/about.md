## About me
<!-- I am currently a second-year master student at GTIIT, supervised by Prof. [Cheng Li](https://sites.gtiit.edu.cn/cligroup/), with Prof. Zvi Pinhas Bar-Yoseph serving as my co-supervisor at Technion. I completed my B.E. degree in Automation at Central South University. -->

I am currently a second-year master's student in Mechanical Engineering at the Technionâ€“Israel Institute of Technology, enrolled in a joint training program with GTIIT. My primary advisor is Prof. [Cheng Li](https://sites.gtiit.edu.cn/cligroup/) at GTIIT, and I am co-supervised by Prof. [Zvi Pinhas Bar-Yoseph](https://meeng.technion.ac.il/en/member/zvi-pinhas-bar-yoseph/) at Technion. I completed my B.E. degree in Automation at Central South University.

## Research interests

<!-- My research interests span bio-inspired robotics, particularly focusing on bipedal robots, flapping-wing drones, and humanoid robots. I'm committed to integrating physics-informed machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to enhance robotic locomotion, control efficiency, and autonomy, especially in complex and dynamic environments. 

Additionally, I have experience with fluid dynamics and intelligent measurement technologies, combining experimental and computational approaches. <u>Currently, I am actively seeking PhD opportunities to further explore and expand these interdisciplinary research directions</u>. -->

My research interests include bio-inspired robotics, with particular enthusiasm for bipedal robots, flapping-wing drones, and humanoid systems. I am especially interested in integrating physics-informed machine learning and reinforcement learning to enhance robotic locomotion, control efficiency, and autonomy in complex, dynamic environments.

In previous projects, I have worked on UAV-based environmental sensing and data-driven modeling, combining experimental measurements with computational techniques such as LSTM and PINNs. These experiences have built a strong foundation in perception-driven modeling and intelligent system design.
