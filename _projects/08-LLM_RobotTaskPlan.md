# <!-- excerpt: "This study presents a custom hexacopter UAV platform that integrates a full-scale sonic anemometer with a multi-resolution digital in-line holography system to capture real-time, three-dimensional wind vectors and micrometer- to millimeter-scale particle distributions in the atmospheric boundary layer, using time- and frequency-domain corrections to eliminate rotor-induced disturbances and achieve high-precision turbulence statistics and particle sizing."

**Abstract:**

Designed and implemented a high-level task planning system powered by large language models (LLMs), enabling users to control a reinforcement-learning–driven wheeled–legged robot via natural language commands. The system integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge-assisted understanding, generates action sequences that seamlessly interface with the RL control module, and successfully reproduces task execution in both simulation and on physical hardware.
