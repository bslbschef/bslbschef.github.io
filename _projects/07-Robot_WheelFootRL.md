# <!-- excerpt: "This study presents a custom hexacopter UAV platform that integrates a full-scale sonic anemometer with a multi-resolution digital in-line holography system to capture real-time, three-dimensional wind vectors and micrometer- to millimeter-scale particle distributions in the atmospheric boundary layer, using time- and frequency-domain corrections to eliminate rotor-induced disturbances and achieve high-precision turbulence statistics and particle sizing."

**Abstract:**

Designed and implemented a biped robot locomotion control system using Isaac Gym / MuJoCo. Developed PPO-based policy achieving stable walking over uneven terrains with sensor noise and domain randomization. Achieved X% improvement in energy efficiency over baseline.
